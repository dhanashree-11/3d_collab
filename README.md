# 3D Collab - Android Bootcamp

Hello there! 👋 
## About

This repository is part of the Discover Design Develop (3D) Campaign organized under GDSC AISSMS IOIT. In this 2-day bootcamp, I had the pleasure of guiding beginners in creating a hands-on Dark-Light mode application using Kotlin.

## What's Inside?

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the Dark-Light mode application.
- `tutorial/`: Find step-by-step instructions on building the application in the [Tutorial.md](tutorial/Tutorial.md) file.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhanashree-11/3d-collab.git
