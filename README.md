# 3D Collab - Android Bootcamp

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the 3D Collab GitHub repository, where we dive into the world of Android app development. This repository contains the materials and code for the Dark-Light mode basic application that we built during the GDSC 2 Days Android Bootcamp.

## What's Inside?

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the Dark-Light mode application.
- `tutorial/`: Find step-by-step instructions on building the application in the [Tutorial.md](tutorial/Tutorial.md) file.
